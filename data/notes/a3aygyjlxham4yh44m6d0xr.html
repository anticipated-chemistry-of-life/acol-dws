<p>We started the implementation of the random markov field. The main discussion
was how can we store all the data- that we need in a reasonable amount of memory. To do so we decided
to use a uint64 vecore to store the data where each bit represents a different value of the class.
The first 16 bits are used to store the counter of the MCMC, for counting how many times our combination
(species-molecule) was a 1. The 17th bit is to store the actual state of the combination (if it is 1 or 0).
The next 47 bits are used as index of the combination in the molecule and species vectors.</p>
<p>We are now discussing if a vector is the best way to store the data or if we should use a hashmap
(<code>std::unordered_map</code>).
It seems like a vector with a "hinted" binary search could lead to extremely fast access to the data.</p>
<h3 id="z-dimension">Z dimension<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#z-dimension"></a></h3>
<p>For the Z dimension of the model, since we don't need to store the counter, we decided to go with a int32 where the
value is the coordinate of the vector and the sign is the state of the combination.</p>

<p>Luca has been working on different models to predict the classification of a molecule. He has also
been working on the classification of MS2 spectra to chemical classifications. We would ideally try to develop
a model that can predict a smiles or a chemical fingerprint given a MS2 spectrum.</p>

<p>I am also working from time to time to create a binding beween C++ and Rust for the RDKit library. I am
a bit in contact with the creators of the crate but they are not very responsive. MAybe I should
fully develop my own fork.  </p>
