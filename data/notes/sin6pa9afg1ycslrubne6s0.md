# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2024.11.28


## Notes
### Meeting with Daniel Probst. 
Goal: library more *modular* than RDKit. RDKit is a big lib and if you want to parse a single smiles,
you have to load the whole library.

Switch to more functional programming. No quantum calculations or force fields. Not only work with small molecules
but also with proteins and allow for pdb files.

Marvin Sakler works at Microsoft and might join the link.
