We created a couple of example to help us understand the update of $Z$ in the Random Markov Field model.
We realised we had problems in naming conventions so on the 27.11.2024 Madleina and I decided to refactor the 
code base to make the varibale names more understandable and accurate to what we are trying to achieve.

### $Z$ is specific to each dimension. 
We will have one Z for each dimension.

The two images below show an example of the update of $Z$. 

We see that the cross $\times$ is part of the varibale dimension 1 wheter the star $*$ is part of the variable dimension 0. 

The $Z$ for a specific dimension has as dimensions the number of internal nodes in the variable dimension and the number of leaves in all other dimensions.
