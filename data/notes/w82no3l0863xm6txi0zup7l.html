<p>With Madleina we continued working on the MRF. We are still working on the update of Y. This part is tricky
because the elements of Y vector are not independent for each dimension. We had to come up
with a couple of tricks to make it work. Right now it is difficult to create unit tests
and we might test the model directly with simulations.</p>

<h2 id="sirius-database">Sirius database<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#sirius-database"></a></h2>
<p>This was a simple and quick thing to do. Pascal Pamrein created a database of in-silico reactions
of molecules in LOTUS with some enzymes-SMARTS. This created a database of about 3 million compounds.
I converted this database into a database for Sirius 6. We now hope that some of those "synthetic" molecules
will be present in future mass spec runs. </p>
<h2 id="cleaning-lotus">Cleaning LOTUS<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cleaning-lotus"></a></h2>
<p>Currently trying to find different ways of cleaning up lotus. I have added a filter for single atoms,
double atoms, and NP-score likeness. This filters about 4% if the compounds.</p>
<h2 id="species-hammer">Species-hammer<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#species-hammer"></a></h2>
<p>Since LOTUS is highly biased, Luca told me to parse Pubmed in search of occurences of the molecules in lotus
and then use this information as a heuristic to estimate the presence of the molecules across the tree of life.
So far, we have very little data so the output of Hammer will probably be quite bad. </p>
<h2 id="bachelor-students">Bachelor students<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#bachelor-students"></a></h2>
<p>In order for the bachelor students to start nicely in February, I have to prepare some material for them: </p>
<ul>
<li>I have to look into the molecules availble in the lab to see if we can create our own fake extract.</li>
<li>I have to look at the different availble NP libraries to see if we there are some more or less cheap ones that we can use.</li>
<li>I need to continue working on the Monorepo because it would be nice to have a working version for them
to use so that they can go sample plants using the app.</li>
</ul>
