<p>We implemented all the updates of the paramenters of the model. Next week we are going to put all the pieces together and run the first simulation.</p>

<li>Dove into Sirius to understand better how the program works. Turns out their approach is quite robust. </li>
<li>I tried different models to go from MS2 spectra to molecules. I first started with small text generation models but there is not enough data.</li>
<li>I then thought about splitting the problem in two parts : 1. predict the molecular fingerprint and 2. predict the molecule from the fingerprint. Turns out this exactly what Sirius does (along with MSNovelist).</li>
<li>Currently testing out MassSpecGym to see if I can train small models to extract molecular fingerprints from mass spec. I am using MS2DeepScore to embed the MS2 spectra.</li>
