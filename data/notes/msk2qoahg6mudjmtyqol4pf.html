<p>To do simulations : </p>
<ul>
<li>Draw branch length </li>
<li>Draw the mus</li>
<li>In the <code>void TMarkovField::_simulateUnderPrior(Storage *)</code> function, we need to first draw the roots based on the </li>
</ul>
<p>For each tree, go over all cliques, and for each clique, draw a value for the root just from the stationary distribution.
Then go over all internal nodes and draw the values based from transition probabilites. If it is a one, we store it in the Z of the tree.
Then we have Z. </p>
<p>Then we simulate the Y. In order to draw a Y we need the cliques in all dimensions. Naive approach: loop over all Ys.
For each Y get all cliques of that Y. Calculate the probability of leaf=1 for each leaf representing that Y given the parent the of that
leaf. Multiply all those probabilities and draw a value form that product of probabilites. If the value drawn is a one, we store it in a Y.</p>
<p>Then this Y can be used to simulate a Lotus data (this function has already been written). </p>
