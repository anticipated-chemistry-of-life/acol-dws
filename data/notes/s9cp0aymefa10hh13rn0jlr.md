Onion technique

## Oral presentation
- PowerPoint or not ?
- 1 slide per minute (if you have 10 minutes, create 10 slides and then dispatch these 10 slides according to what you want to say)
- make a template
- do not overfill
- images help
- Microphone (if you have big room, accept microphone)

Look at the audience, be authentic (**be yourself**), talk slow, use the space you have, prepare for tech issues, visualization

## Social media communication
- Platform specific
- Consistency
- Keep it short
- Prepare for pushback
- for video content, prioritize good audio, speak faster than you think
