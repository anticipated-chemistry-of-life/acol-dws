The main discussion\nwas how can we store all the data- that we need in a reasonable amount of memory. To do so we decided\nto use a uint64 vecore to store the data where each bit represents a different value of the class.\nThe first 16 bits are used to store the counter of the MCMC, for counting how many times our combination\n(species-molecule) was a 1. The 17th bit is to store the actual state of the combination (if it is 1 or 0).\nThe next 47 bits are used as index of the combination in the molecule and species vectors.</p>\n<p>We are now discussing if a vector is the best way to store the data or if we should use a hashmap\n(<code>std::unordered_map</code>).\nIt seems like a vector with a \"hinted\" binary search could lead to extremely fast access to the data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"z-dimension\">Z dimension<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#z-dimension\"></a></h3>\n<p>For the Z dimension of the model, since we don't need to store the counter, we decided to go with a int32 where the\nvalue is the coordinate of the vector and the sign is the state of the combination.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ms2-compound-or-compound-to-ms2\">MS2 compound or compound to MS2<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#ms2-compound-or-compound-to-ms2\"></a></h2>\n<p>Luca has been working on different models to predict the classification of a molecule. He has also\nbeen working on the classification of MS2 spectra to chemical classifications. We would ideally try to develop\na model that can predict a smiles or a chemical fingerprint given a MS2 spectrum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rdkit-rust\">RDKit Rust<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#rdkit-rust\"></a></h2>\n<p>I am also working from time to time to create a binding beween C++ and Rust for the RDKit library. I am\na bit in contact with the creators of the crate but they are not very responsive. MAybe I should\nfully develop my own fork.  </p>","noteIndex":{"id":"3rbfqqbp7pwbkdcrgc97u7l","title":"Anticipated Chemistry of Life","desc":"","updated":1727785927929,"created":1671985562294,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"acol-dws"},"contentHash":"f1947bd87c177e8ee5739c542c5dc574","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-the-dendron-of-the-anticipated-chemistry-of-life":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to the Dendron of the Anticipated Chemistry of Life","value":"welcome-to-the-dendron-of-the-anticipated-chemistry-of-life","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["l03fwlci5f5rdpot3v7oli6","zxc3pre92d542wg70hmdhgl","289i7valu3z4gm4g4lcullo","jljxwgcjy7uwcw3inriqbhd","bt513r0uipm1jyk3bi1mmwu","5ejymrqkm3f3rsmlxegreyp"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Welcome to the Dendron of the Anticipated Chemistry of Life\n\nThis dendron has the purpose to serve as a laboratory notebook for my PhD thesis.
