This approach uses quantum chemistry calculations.\nI'd like to test it out to see how well the results are. However, the calculations are really heavy. </p>\n<p>I've been testing it out with the first molecule in MassSpecGym but am getting sometimes pretty good results and sometimes not.\nI still need to tune a bit the parameters to see what works.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emi-monorepo\">EMI-Monorepo<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#emi-monorepo\"></a></h2>\n<p>Went back to the monorepo with Luca. Currently, creating a crate that generates mermaid graphs automatically. This\nallows us to visualize better the structure of the database. </p>\n<h2 id=\"random-markov-field\">Random Markov Field<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#random-markov-field\"></a></h2>\n<p>As Dan said I should create a standard way to plot all the annotation tools tested (MetFrag, CFM-ID, Sirius). </p>\n<p>Turns out that Sirius is good for getting top 1 results but is the worst to find the total number of results. It tested by giving\nall the spectra present in MassSpecGym to Sirius and it ignored about half of them. </p>\n<h3 id=\"todo\">TODO<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#todo\"></a></h3>\n<p>Currently the update of Y is really slow if we start to have many nodes in our tree. What I would like to do is to\nchange the code so that only if all threads ask for an update of the sheet, then the sheet will be updated. Currently we are not\ndoing this. What we do is that we parallelize on the last internal loop. But that one is already quite fast so there might be a lot of overhead\nof the threads by doing so. </p>\n<p>What I want is to check if all threads are true, then do and update. </p>\n<p>To use :  <code>std::all_of</code> and <code>omp barrier</code> ?</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"3rbfqqbp7pwbkdcrgc97u7l","title":"Anticipated Chemistry of Life","desc":"","updated":1727785927929,"created":1671985562294,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"acol-dws"},"contentHash":"f1947bd87c177e8ee5739c542c5dc574","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-the-dendron-of-the-anticipated-chemistry-of-life":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to the Dendron of the Anticipated Chemistry of Life","value":"welcome-to-the-dendron-of-the-anticipated-chemistry-of-life","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["l03fwlci5f5rdpot3v7oli6","zxc3pre92d542wg70hmdhgl","289i7valu3z4gm4g4lcullo","jljxwgcjy7uwcw3inriqbhd","bt513r0uipm1jyk3bi1mmwu","5ejymrqkm3f3rsmlxegreyp"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Welcome to the Dendron of the Anticipated Chemistry of Life\n\nThis dendron has the purpose to serve as a laboratory notebook for my PhD thesis.
