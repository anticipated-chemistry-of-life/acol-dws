We are still working on the update of Y. This part is tricky\nbecause the elements of Y vector are not independent for each dimension. We had to come up\nwith a couple of tricks to make it work. Right now it is difficult to create unit tests\nand we might test the model directly with simulations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/acol-dws/assets/images/20250122_145406.jpg\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"sirius-database\">Sirius database<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#sirius-database\"></a></h2>\n<p>This was a simple and quick thing to do. Pascal Pamrein created a database of in-silico reactions\nof molecules in LOTUS with some enzymes-SMARTS. This created a database of about 3 million compounds.\nI converted this database into a database for Sirius 6. We now hope that some of those \"synthetic\" molecules\nwill be present in future mass spec runs. </p>\n<h2 id=\"cleaning-lotus\">Cleaning LOTUS<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#cleaning-lotus\"></a></h2>\n<p>Currently trying to find different ways of cleaning up lotus. I have added a filter for single atoms,\ndouble atoms, and NP-score likeness. This filters about 4% if the compounds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"species-hammer\">Species-hammer<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#species-hammer\"></a></h2>\n<p>Since LOTUS is highly biased, Luca told me to parse Pubmed in search of occurences of the molecules in lotus\nand then use this information as a heuristic to estimate the presence of the molecules across the tree of life.\nSo far, we have very little data so the output of Hammer will probably be quite bad. </p>\n<h2 id=\"bachelor-students\">Bachelor students<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#bachelor-students\"></a></h2>\n<p>In order for the bachelor students to start nicely in February, I have to prepare some material for them: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have to look into the molecules availble in the lab to see if we can create our own fake extract.</li>\n<li>I have to look at the different availble NP libraries to see if we there are some more or less cheap ones that we can use.</li>\n<li>I need to continue working on the Monorepo because it would be nice to have a working version for them\nto use so that they can go sample plants using the app.</li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"3rbfqqbp7pwbkdcrgc97u7l","title":"Anticipated Chemistry of Life","desc":"","updated":1727785927929,"created":1671985562294,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"acol-dws"},"contentHash":"f1947bd87c177e8ee5739c542c5dc574","links":[],"anchors":{"welcome-to-the-dendron-of-the-anticipated-chemistry-of-life":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to the Dendron of the Anticipated Chemistry of Life","value":"welcome-to-the-dendron-of-the-anticipated-chemistry-of-life","line":8,"column":0,"depth":1}},"children":["l03fwlci5f5rdpot3v7oli6","zxc3pre92d542wg70hmdhgl","289i7valu3z4gm4g4lcullo","jljxwgcjy7uwcw3inriqbhd","bt513r0uipm1jyk3bi1mmwu","5ejymrqkm3f3rsmlxegreyp"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n# Welcome to the Dendron of the Anticipated Chemistry of Life\n\nThis dendron has the purpose to serve as a laboratory notebook for my PhD thesis.
