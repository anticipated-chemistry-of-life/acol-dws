# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

## Events of this week
- Luca came to Fribourg. He showed me how we are goind to reimplement the python code generation packages to the 
`syn` crate. This allows us to generate syntax compliant code for Rust and we can do actual type checking.
- I will need to dive with Luca into his "Hammer" package as it can be useful for my thesis.
- I worked a bit on the metaprogramming part of the monorepo.

- Meeting on Wednesday about the DBGI wrapup. We discussed what everyone did during the two years project.
