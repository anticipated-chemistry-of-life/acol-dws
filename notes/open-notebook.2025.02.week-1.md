# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2025.02.07


## Events of this week
### Markov Random Field
Continued creating the functions to simulate data to test the model. Simulations for Lotus are 
done, I also have done the simulations for the $\mu$ in the cliques. I also added 
simulations for Z now. 

We are missing the sampling of Y. I will need to ask Madleina next week how to do this. This 
part is taking a bit more time that expected. I hope we can run some simulations maybe at the end of next week.

### Bachelor students
I looked into the dataset we are going to buy for the students. There were a couple of mistakes in 
the excel sheet that was sent to me.

### EMI Monorepo
Continued a bit on the monrepo. Will have to create the tables for the weather data.
