We created a couple of example to help us understand the update of $Z$ in the Random Markov Field model.
We realised we had problems in naming conventions so on the 27.11.2024 Madleina and I decided to refactor the 
code to make the varibale names more understandable and accurate to what we are trying to achieve. 

### $Z$ is specific to each dimension. 
We will have one Z for each dimension.
