# This is Marco's daily open-notebook.

Today is 2025.02.10

## Meeting PMA and Bachelor Students
They should start in two weeks i.e. the 3rd March 2025. 

1. we need the infrastructure to collect samples in the JB. However mass spec is down, and QField is not setup
so the best would be to have the monorepo up and running.
2. In the wait, we start with the fake extract. --> Data cleaning of Compactus, calculate logP, NP score, etc. 
   1. Create github account
   2. add to the different organizations
   3. Setup dendron (often a mess...) 
   4. Create blank repo for datacleaning of Compactus.
