##Â Meeting with Dan
### Mass spec data

Given that we have mass spec gym, we can estimate the distribution of the score given 

For the truth dataset
1. Run $k$ methods of choice for true molecules
2. get the distribution of scores for the true molecule for each method $k$
3. choose 255 bins to represent that distribution
4. Determine the likelihood for each bin

#### To Do
Play around with the scores of the different annotations tools to see if we can reduce the number of times the true molecule actually
a score of $0.0$.

### Speed of insertion Y vector
